# Task Management API Documentation

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project is a simple **Task Management API** built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It allows users to perform **CRUD operations** on tasks, filter tasks by completion status or priority, and sort them by creation date. The data is stored in-memory (i.e., not persisted to a database).

### Features

* Retrieve all tasks
* Retrieve a task by ID
* Filter tasks by completion status
* Sort tasks by creation date (ascending/descending)
* Filter tasks by priority (low, medium, high)
* Create, update, and delete tasks

## ðŸ§° Getting Started

### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   > Server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Test Using Postman or cURL**

   * Import endpoints in Postman
   * Use `http://localhost:3000/tasks` as base URL
